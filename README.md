# Leaving the bar

Please review the [commit history on GitHub](https://github.com/katrinleinweber/leaving-the-bar/commits/) or `git log --oneline | grep "Convert"`
to learn about the the individual steps of changing the code to update the plot.
It doesn't look as nice as the [official version](http://thenode.biologists.com/leaving-bar-five-steps/)
but hopefully proves useful for highlighting the principles of the conversion
steps.
